# Udacity Frontend Web Developer Project 5 (Final)

Create the FEND Capstone Travel App to put together all the learnings achieved during the course.

## Description
In the words of Udacity, this project aims to allow us put all the skills learnt into one project to build our own custom travel app. The project will include a simple form where users can enter the location they are travelling to and the date they will be leaving.
